# TKB CHAIN (DISCONTINUED)
I know that this is crap, I tried creating a "blockchain" with almost no knowledge of Web3.  
This is NOT accurate and I don't think this is how it works...  
This does not support decentralization (not totally), nor wallet keys, etc...  
Please do not open issues, PRs, etc... because I will **NOT** update this project anymore.

## Setup
1. run ``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
2. edit ``settings.json``
3. run ``python blockchain.py``

## Mine some TKC (TKB Coin)
1. Run ``python miner.py``
2. Enter amount of threads to use.
3. Enter username to mine for.
4. Wait for it to mine.
5. Enjoy and hope it works
